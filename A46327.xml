            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>COventry stands fast to the Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strongly fortified, and most of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants well affected people, and though the Cavaliers have endeavoured by many stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems and plots to gain the Towne, yet they have been valiantly repulst, and been forced to retreat with losse.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Brookes</hi> has a speciall eye to this place and watches the Cavaliers in all their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, their only aim being to gain the Citie by reason that it is rich and well fortified.</p>
               <p>Severall tumults has been of late raised in the Towne by severall deboyst fellowes, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themselves for the King, which being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the Sherifs, was turned out of the Gates, to seeeke their lodgings in a Hay-cock.</p>

               <p>THe Cavaliers had possessed themselves of <hi>Tamworth,</hi> doing many outrages on severall persons, which caused the town to send privately to <hi>Adderson, Non-Eaten,</hi> and other adjoyning
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46865:4"/> towns, desiring them to come in to their assistance: which they did accordingly. For in the night they (to the number of 4000. well armed) stole upon the towne; at whose arrivall the Allarum being given, the towne rose with them, seizing on such Armes as the Cavaliers had left carelesly being drunke, and disordered, by which meanes they redeemed the towne, took many of the Cavaliers prisoners, killed others, to the great joy of the towne, and sorrow of the malignant party.</p>

               <p>THe Cavaliers having beene so bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated at Tamworth, made head again, and went up against Medingham, a little Towne but very populous, intending to secure themselves, or at least to redeeme what they had lost at Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, but their hopes proved cleane contrary, for in stead of getting what they expected, they lost more then before, for the inhabitants of the Towne having notise of their behaviour at Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, and knowledg that they were driven from thence, put themselves into a posture of defence, for feare that they should come against them, and as they feared so it happened: for had they not prevented them by a timely fear, they had had cause to fear, and curse their untimely neglect.</p>
               <p>The Cavaliers come confidently upon the Towne, never dreaming of any danger, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly at their arival at the entry of the Town, they met with such a welcome, that some of them lay tumbling on the Ground, and the rest ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

               </head>
               <p>BEfore I begin, I will declare what enemies thou art to fight with, and the cause why they are thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, since the perfect knowledge of the justice of thy cause gives great encouragement to the action, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes crownes the actor with a wreathe of glory.</p>
               <p>The enemies thou art to fight withall, are Court Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, Papists, both Gentry and Laick, Prelates, and their adherents, the Courts, and Ministers of the Law, who have abused the Law, selling Justice to the adversary, and betraying the poore innocent to ruine and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Projecters and Monopolizers, who for private gain have robbed thee of thy liberty: So that betweene the Prelate and the Projector, thou enjoyedst but the tythe, to whom the whole did belong.</p>
               <p>These actions of theirs made them labour to disaffect the King to Parliaments; but the necessity of the King, and the grievous oppressions that lay heavy upon the Kingdome, enforced the calling of a Parliament, which was no sooner called; but dissolved. A second Parliament
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46865:5"/> was likewise inforced, which being assembled, they did likewise endeavour to dissolve: but God being stronger then they, wrought for us, and turned their plots upon themselves, strengthning the Parliament in a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner, that they withstood all their plots and stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems from the beginning to this day.</p>
               <p>And now having failed in all their attempts, they have now laid all at the stake, waging war against God and his Church, in which war they have almost invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this whole Kingdome, if God stand not for us, for against all there is none to rise up, but onely the poore Protestant, armed with the justice of his cause, Religion and Law, in defence of which every one that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be a Citizen of Jerusalem must valiantly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life and and fortune, against the usurping Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans abroad, and the seditious Jewes at home.</p>
               <p>Let these three motives be as so many spurs to prick you forward to this service.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your Religion (which is Gods cause) lies at stake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The King and his posterity run an equall hazard.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Laws of the Land, liberty of the Subject, nay, the very being of the Kingdome, are utterly in danger of subversion, should this Malignant party get the upper hand, Therefore let us all with one accord put on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muor of righteousnesse with the breast-plate of faith, and then doubtlesse God will fight with us, and if we lose our lives in this cause we may joyfully say with Saint Paul, <hi>We have fought a good sight, wee have finished our course, and in heaven wee shall receive a Crowne of glory.</hi>
